# FactCheck

An automated fact checker with an optional moral evaluation step. **FactCheck** helps users break down any statement into concrete facts, assess their scientific relevance, and optionally evaluate moral considerations.

## Features

  Enter your statement, list the necessary facts, determine factual relevance, and optionally perform a moral check.

  Progress is highlighted step by step. The interface automatically shows or hides form elements based on user choices.
  
- **Local Storage (IndexedDB)**  
  All evaluations are stored in your browserâ€™s IndexedDB. No server is required.
  
- **History & Editing**  
  Each completed evaluation appears in the History panel. Click on an entry to reload and edit it (replacing the old entry).
  
- **PDF/Print Export**  
  Export or print a simple table of all stored evaluations.
